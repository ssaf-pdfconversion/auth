Develop a java auth server for a distributed system:

1. Using a maven project (if youre using eclipse: ben maven-archetype-sim con el catalogo de Maven Central y seleccionan el ultimo q aparece. Dice org.maven.archetypes)

2. add the dependencies on the .pom file:


for the .env: 
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.cdimascio</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-dotenv</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.2</version>
</dependency>


for mariadb:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.7</version> <!-- use the latest version available -->
</dependency>

Then, we do the environment for the .env (you get it? environment for the env? Gold comedy)

we create the .env with your db creeds (usual #stuff)

example!!

DB_URL=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/your_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password


then we create the java class for the connection!! In this case, its called DBManager bc we manage the db with it.

Now thats set, lets do our queries!! here we're creating an auth server so we're creating a login and register queries 
for the DB. For best practices, we'll create the queries in one class and then use them on a factory class that implements
 the validation methods and everything!!


**NOTE: I did a refactor of the code for better understanding. There are three more folders. 
1.Utils which contains functions that are used across classes.
2. Interfaces (for the interfaces used for connecting the project via distributed systems, also just the interfaces for implementing things.)
3. Models, which contains business logic. 

its better this way so we can find files easily!!

**************
First, we do the Register model. We need to hash the password for better security, so we use a library called Bcrypt. The maven dependency is 

<dependency>
    <groupId>at.favre.lib</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcrypt</artifactId>
    <version>0.10.2</version>
</dependency>

but, before getting involved with hash and everything lets do a test with plain text.
